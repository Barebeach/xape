## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes for Reviewers**

### **Token Gating (Temporarily Disabled for Review)**
- **Production Mode**: Normally requires 100 XAPE tokens (Solana blockchain)
- **Review Mode**: Token gating is **DISABLED** for Chrome review
- This allows full testing of all features without blockchain setup
- **Post-Approval**: We will re-enable token gating in a minor update

### **Why Token Gating Exists**
- Prevents spam/abuse of AI features (OpenAI API costs)
- Creates exclusive access for token holders
- Standard practice in crypto extensions

### **Backend Access**
- Extension connects to: `https://postgres-production-958e.up.railway.app`
- This is our secure backend for:
  - AI chat processing (OpenAI)
  - Crypto news aggregation
  - Token balance verification (Solana RPC)
- All communication is HTTPS encrypted

## üìû **Support**

If you encounter any issues during review:
- Email: support@xape.io

## ‚úÖ **Post-Approval Plan**

After Chrome approval, we will:
1. Re-enable token gating (100 XAPE requirement)

3. Token holders get exclusive access
4. Extension continues to work exactly the same for approved users

This is a standard practice for blockchain-based extensions to prevent abuse while allowing thorough review.
